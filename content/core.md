## Pods    
In Kubernetes, a group of one or more containers is called a pod. Containers in a pod are deployed together, and are started, stopped, and replicated as a group. The simplest pod definition describes the deployment of a single container. For example, an nginx web server pod might be defined as such

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mynginx
  namespace: default
  labels:
    run: nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name: mynginx
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
```

A pod definition is a declaration of a desired state. Desired state is a very important concept in the Kubernetes model. Many things present a desired state to the system, and it is Kubernetes’ responsibility to make sure that the current state matches the desired state. For example, when you create a Pod, you declare that you want the containers in it to be running. If the containers happen to not be running (e.g. program failure, …), Kubernetes will continue to (re-)create them for you in order to drive them to the desired state. This process continues until the Pod is deleted.

Create a pod containing an nginx server from the pod-nginx.yaml file

    [root@kubem00 ~]# kubectl create -f pod-nginx.yaml

List all pods:

    [root@kubem00 ~]# kubectl get pods -o wide
    NAME      READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE       IP            NODE
    mynginx   1/1       Running   0          8m        172.30.21.2   kuben03

Describe the pod:

    [root@kubem00 ~]# kubectl describe pod mynginx
    Name:           mynginx
    Namespace:      default
    Node:           kuben03/10.10.10.83
    Start Time:     Wed, 05 Apr 2017 11:17:28 +0200
    Labels:         run=nginx
    Status:         Running
    IP:             172.30.21.2
    Controllers:    <none>
    Containers:
      mynginx:
        Container ID:       docker://a35dafd66ac03f28ce4213373eaea56a547288389ea5c901e27df73593aa5949
        Image:              nginx:latest
        Image ID:           docker-pullable://docker.io/nginx
        Port:               80/TCP
        State:              Running
          Started:          Wed, 05 Apr 2017 11:17:37 +0200
        Ready:              True
        Restart Count:      0
        Volume Mounts:
          /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount from default-token-92z22 (ro)
        Environment Variables:      <none>
    Conditions:
      Type          Status
      Initialized   True
      Ready         True
      PodScheduled  True
    Volumes:
      default-token-92z22:
        Type:       Secret (a volume populated by a Secret)
        SecretName: default-token-92z22
    QoS Class:      BestEffort
    Tolerations:    <none>
    Events:
    ...

Delete the pod:

    [root@kubem00 ~]# kubectl delete pod mynginx
    pod "mynginx" deleted

In the example above, we had a pod with a single container nginx running inside.

Kubernetes let's user to have multiple containers running in a pod. All containers inside the same pod share the same resources, e.g. network and volumes and are always scheduled togheter on the same node. The primary reason that Pods can have multiple containers is to support helper applications that assist a primary application. Typical examples of helper applications are data pullers, data pushers, and proxies. Helper and primary applications often need to communicate with each other, typically through a shared filesystem or loopback network interface.

## Labels
In Kubernetes, labels are a system to organize objects into groups. Labels are key-value pairs that are attached to each object. Label selectors can be passed along with a request to the apiserver to retrieve a list of objects which match that label selector.

To add a label to a pod, add a labels section under metadata in the pod definition:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  labels:
    run: nginx
...
```

To label a running pod

      [root@kubem00 ~]# kubectl label pod mynginx type=webserver
      pod "mynginx" labeled

To list pods based on labels

      [root@kubem00 ~]# kubectl get pods -l type=webserver
      NAME      READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
      mynginx   1/1       Running   0          21m

Labels can be applied not only to pods but also to other Kuberntes objects like nodes. For example, we want to label or worker nodes based on the their position in the datacenter

      [root@kubem00 ~]# kubectl label node kuben01 rack=rack01
      node "kuben01" labeled
      
      [root@kubem00 ~]# kubectl get nodes -l rack=rack01
      NAME      STATUS    AGE
      kuben01   Ready     2d
      
      [root@kubem00 ~]# kubectl label node kuben02 rack=rack01
      node "kuben02" labeled
      
      [root@kubem00 ~]# kubectl get nodes -l rack=rack01
      NAME      STATUS    AGE
      kuben01   Ready     2d
      kuben02   Ready     2d

Labels are also used as selector for services and deployments.

## Controllers
A Replication Controller ensures that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any one time. In other words, a Replication Controller makes sure that a pod or homogeneous set of pods are always up and available. If there are too many pods, it will kill some. If there are too few, it will start more. Unlike manually created pods, the pods maintained by a Replication Controller are automatically replaced if they fail, get deleted, or are terminated.

A Replica Controller configuration consists of:

 * The number of replicas desired
 * The pod definition
 * The selector to bind the managed pod

A selector is a label assigned to the pods that are managed by the replica controller. Labels are included in the pod definition that the replica controller instantiates. The replica controller uses the selector to determine how many instances of the pod are already running in order to adjust as needed.

In the ``nginx-rc.yaml`` file, define a replica controller with replica 1 for our nginx pod.
```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ReplicationController
metadata:
  name: nginx
  namespace: default
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    run: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      name: nginx
      labels:
        run: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

Create a replica controller

    [root@kubem00 ~]# kubectl create -f nginx-rc.yaml
    replicationcontroller "nginx" created

List and describe a replica controller

    [root@kubem00 ~]# kubectl get rc
    NAME      DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
    nginx     3         3         3         1m

    [root@kubem00 ~]# kubectl describe rc nginx
    Name:           nginx
    Namespace:      default
    Image(s):       nginx:latest
    Selector:       run=nginx
    Labels:         run=nginx
    Replicas:       3 current / 3 desired
    Pods Status:    3 Running / 0 Waiting / 0 Succeeded / 0 Failed
    No volumes.

The Replication Controller makes it easy to scale the number of replicas up or down, either manually or by an auto-scaling control agent, by simply updating the replicas field. For example, scale dow to zero replicas in order to delete all pods controlled by a given replica controller

    [root@kubem00 ~]# kubectl scale rc nginx --replicas=0
    replicationcontroller "nginx" scaled

    [root@kubem00 ~]# kubectl get rc nginx
    NAME      DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
    nginx     0         0         0         7m

Scale out the replica controller to create new pods

    [root@kubem00 ~]# kubectl scale rc nginx --replicas=9
    replicationcontroller "nginx" scaled

    [root@kubem00 ~]# kubectl get rc nginx
    NAME      DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
    nginx     9         9         0         9m

Also in case of failure of a node, the replica controller takes care of keep the same number of pods by scheduling the containers running on the failed node to the remaining nodes in the cluster.

To delete a replica controller

    [root@kubem00 ~]# kubectl delete rc/nginx
    replicationcontroller "nginx" deleted

## Deployments
A Deployment provides declarative updates for pods and replicas. You only need to describe the desired state in a Deployment object, and it will change the actual state to the desired state. The Deployment object defines the following details:

  * The elements of a Replication Controller definition
  * The strategy for transitioning between deployments

To create a deployment for our nginx webserver, edit the ``nginx-deploy.yaml`` file as
```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  generation: 1
  labels:
    run: nginx
  name: nginx
  namespace: default
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      run: nginx
  strategy:
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 1
      maxUnavailable: 1
    type: RollingUpdate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        run: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: nginx:latest
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        name: nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
          protocol: TCP
      dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
      restartPolicy: Always
      securityContext: {}
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 30
```

and create the deployment

    [root@kubem00 ~]# kubectl create -f nginx-deploy.yaml
    deployment "nginx" created

The deployment creates the following objects

    [root@kubem00 ~]# kubectl get all -l run=nginx

    NAME           DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
    deploy/nginx   3         3         3            3           4m

    NAME                 DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
    rs/nginx-664452237   3         3         3         4m

    NAME                       READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    po/nginx-664452237-h8dh0   1/1       Running   0          4m
    po/nginx-664452237-ncsh1   1/1       Running   0          4m
    po/nginx-664452237-vts63   1/1       Running   0          4m

According to the definitions set in the file, above, there are three pods and a replica set. The replica set object is very similar to the replica controller object we saw before. You may notice that the name of the replica set is always ``<name-of-deployment>-<hash value of the pod template>``

A deployment - as a replica controller, can be scaled up and down

    [root@kubem00 ~]# kubectl scale deploy nginx --replicas=6
    deployment "nginx" scaled

    [root@kubem00 ~]# kubectl get deploy nginx
    NAME      DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
    nginx     6         6         6            3           11m

In addition to replicas management, a deployment also defines the strategy for updates pods

```yaml
  strategy:
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 1
      maxUnavailable: 1
    type: RollingUpdate
```

In the snippet above, we set the update strategy as rolling update. During the lifetime of an application, some services need to be update, for example because the image changed. To update a service without an outage, Kubernetes updates one or more pod at a time, rather than taking down the entire application.

For example, to update the pods with a different version of nginx image

    [root@kubem00 ~]# kubectl set image deploy nginx nginx=nginx:1.9.1
    deployment "nginx" image updated

    [root@kubem00 ~]# kubectl rollout status deploy nginx
    Waiting for rollout to finish: 4 out of 6 new replicas have been updated...
    Waiting for rollout to finish: 4 out of 6 new replicas have been updated...
    Waiting for rollout to finish: 4 out of 6 new replicas have been updated...
    ...
    deployment "nginx" successfully rolled out

    [root@kubem00 ~]# kubectl get deploy
    NAME      DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
    nginx     6         6         6            6           40m
    
    [root@kubem00 ~]# kubectl get rs
    NAME               DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
    nginx-2148973303   6         6         6         1m
    nginx-664452237    0         0         0         40m
    
    [root@kubem00 ~]# kubectl get pods
    NAME                     READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    nginx-2148973303-29hff   1/1       Running   0          2m
    nginx-2148973303-91xt9   1/1       Running   0          1m
    nginx-2148973303-cnnt0   1/1       Running   0          2m
    nginx-2148973303-f2hr1   1/1       Running   0          1m
    nginx-2148973303-g5h4f   1/1       Running   0          1m
    nginx-2148973303-xcdlw   1/1       Running   0          1m

Deployment can ensure that only a certain number of pods may be down while they are being updated. By default, it ensures that at least 25% less than the desired number of pods are up. Deployment can also ensure that only a certain number of pods may be created above the desired number of pods. By default, it ensures that at most 25% more than the desired number of pods are up.

## Services
Kubernetes pods, as containers, are ephemeral. Replication Controllers create and destroy pods dynamically, e.g. when scaling up or down or when doing rolling updates. While each pod gets its own IP address, even those IP addresses cannot be relied upon to be stable over time. This leads to a problem: if some set of pods provides functionality to other pods inside the Kubernetes cluster, how do those pods find out and keep track of which other?

A Kubernetes Service is an abstraction which defines a logical set of pods and a policy by which to access them. The set of pods targeted by a Service is usually determined by a label selector. Kubernetes offers a simple Endpoints API that is updated whenever the set of pods in a service changes.

To create a service for our nginx webserver, edit the ``nginx-service.yaml`` file

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx
  labels:
    run: nginx
spec:
  selector:
    run: nginx
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 8000
    targetPort: 80
  type: ClusterIP
```

Create the service

    [root@kubem00 ~]# kubectl create -f nginx-service.yaml
    service "nginx" created
    
    [root@kubem00 ~]# kubectl get service -l run=nginx
    NAME      CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
    nginx     10.254.60.24   <none>        8000/TCP    38s

Describe the service

    [root@kubem00 ~]# kubectl describe service nginx
    Name:                   nginx
    Namespace:              default
    Labels:                 run=nginx
    Selector:               run=nginx
    Type:                   ClusterIP
    IP:                     10.254.60.24
    Port:                   <unset> 8000/TCP
    Endpoints:              172.30.21.3:80,172.30.4.4:80,172.30.53.4:80
    Session Affinity:       None
    No events.

The above service is associated to our previous nginx pods. Pay attention to the service selector ``run=nginx`` field. It tells Kubernetes that all pods with the label ``run=nginx`` are associated to this service, and should have traffic distributed amongst them. In other words, the service provides an abstraction layer, and it is the input point to reach all of the associated pods.

Pods can be added to the service arbitrarily. Make sure that the label ``run=nginx`` is associated to any pod we would to bind to the service. Define a new pod from the following file without (intentionally) any label
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mynginx
  namespace: default
  labels:
spec:
  containers:
  - name: mynginx
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
```

Create the new pod

    [root@kubem00 ~]# kubectl create -f nginx-pod.yaml
    pod "mynginx" created

    [root@kubem00 ~]# kubectl get pods
    NAME                    READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    mynginx                 1/1       Running   0          11s
    nginx-664452237-6h8zw   1/1       Running   0          16m
    nginx-664452237-kmmqk   1/1       Running   0          15m
    nginx-664452237-xhnjt   1/1       Running   0          16m

The just created new pod is not still associated to the nginx service

    [root@kubem00 ~]# kubectl get endpoints | grep nginx
    NAME         ENDPOINTS                                    AGE
    nginx        172.30.21.2:80,172.30.4.2:80,172.30.4.3:80   40m


Now, let's to lable the new pod with ``run=nginx`` label

    [root@kubem00 ~]# kubectl label pod mynginx run=nginx
    pod "mynginx" labeled

We can see a new endpoint is added to the service

    [root@kubem00 ~]# kubectl get endpoints | grep nginx
    NAME         ENDPOINTS                                                AGE
    nginx        172.30.21.2:80,172.30.4.2:80,172.30.4.3:80 + 1 more...   46m

Any pod in the cluster need for the nginx service will be able to talk with this service by the service address no matter which IP address will be assigned to the nginx pod. Also, in case of multiple nginx pods, the service abstraction acts as load balancer between the nginx pods.

The picture below shows the relationship between services and pods

![](../img/service-pod.png?raw=true)

Create a pod from the below yaml file
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: busybox
  namespace: default
spec:
  containers:
  - image: busybox
    command:
      - sleep
      - "3600"
    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
    name: busybox
  restartPolicy: Always
```

We'll use this pod to address the nginx service

    [root@kubem00 ~]# kubectl create -f busybox.yaml
    pod "busybox" created

    [root@kubem00 ~]# kubectl exec -it busybox sh
    / # wget -O - 10.254.105.187:8000
    Connecting to 10.254.105.187:8000 (10.254.105.187:8000)
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
    <title>Welcome to nginx!</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    <h1>Welcome to nginx!</h1>
    <p>If you see this page, the nginx web server is successfully installed and
    working. Further configuration is required.</p>
    ...
    </body>
    </html>
    / # exit
    [root@kubem00 ~]#

In kubernetes, the service abstraction acts as stable entrypoint for any application, no matter wich is the IP address of the pod(s) running that application. We can destroy all nginx pods and recreate but service will be always the same IP address and port.

## Volumes
Containers are ephemeral, meaning the container file system only lives as long as the container does. If the application state needs to survive relocation, reboot, and crash of the hosting pod, we need to use some persistent storage mechanism. Kubernetes - as docker does, uses the concept of data volume.  A kubernetes volume has an explicit lifetime, the same as the pod that encloses it. Data stored in a kubernetes volume survive across relocation, reboot, restart and crash of the hosting pod.

In this section, we are going to create two different volume types:

  1. **emptyDir**
  2. **hostPath**

However, kubernetes supports more other volume types. Please, refer to official documentation for details.

### Empty Dir Volume
Here a simple example file ``nginx-volume.yaml`` of nginx pod containing a data volume
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
  namespace: default
  labels:
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
    volumeMounts:
    - name: content-data
      mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
  volumes:
  - name: content-data
    emptyDir: {}
```

The file defines an nginx pod where the served html content directory ``/usr/share/nginx/html`` is mounted as volume. The volume type is ``emptyDir``. This type of volume is created when the pod is assigned to a node, and it exists as long as that pod is running on that node. As the name says, it is initially empty. When the pod is removed from the node for any reason, the data in the emptyDir volume is deleted too.

The Empty Dir volumes are placed on the ``/var/lib/kubelet/pods/POD_ID/volumes/volumes/kubernetes.io~empty-dir/content-data`` of the worker node where the pod is currently running. Please, note that a container crash does not remove a pod from a node, so the data in an emptyDir volume is safe across a container crash.

Create the nginx pod above

    kubectl create -f nginx-volume.yaml
    pod "nginx" created
    
    kubectl get po/nginx
    NAME      READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    nginx     1/1       Running   0          22s

Check for pod IP address and for the worker node hosting the pod

    kubectl get po/nginx -o wide
    NAME      READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE       IP            NODE
    nginx     1/1       Running   0          13m       10.38.3.167   kubew03

Trying to access the nginx application

     curl 10.38.3.167
     403 Forbidden

we get *forbidden* since the html content dir (mounted as volume) is initially empty.

Login to the worker node and populate the volume dir with an html file

    [root@kubew03 ~]# cd /var/lib/kubelet/pods/<POD_ID>/volumes/kubernetes.io~empty-dir/content-data
    echo "Hello World from " $(pwd) > index.html

Now we should be able to get an answer from the pod

    curl 10.38.3.167
    Hello World from /var/lib/kubelet/pods/<POD_ID>/volumes/kubernetes.io~empty-dir/content-data

With the ``emptyDir`` volume type, data in the volume is removed when the pod is deleted from the node where it was running. To achieve data persistence across pod deletion or relocation, we need for a persistent shared storage alternative. 

### Host Path Volume
The other volume type we're gooing to use is ``hostPath``. With this volume type, the volume is mount from an existing directory on the file system of the node hosting the pod. Data inside the host directory are safe to container crashes and restarts as well as to pod deletion. However, if the pod is moved from a node to another one, data on the initial node are no more accessible from the new instance of the pod.

Based on the previous example, define a nginx pod using the host path ``/data/nginx/html`` as data volume for html content
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
  namespace: default
  labels:
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
    volumeMounts:
    - name: content-data
      mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
  nodeSelector:
    kubernetes.io/hostname: kubew05
  volumes:
  - name: content-data
    hostPath:
      path: /data/nginx/html
```

Please, note that host dir must be present on the node hosting the pod before the pod is created by kubernetes. For this reason, we force kubernetes to schedule the pod on a specific node having hostname ``kuben05`` where the volume directory has been first created.

Login to the worker node and create the host directory

    [root@kubew05 ~]# mkdir -p /data/nginx/html

Back to the master node and schedule the pod

    kubectl create -f nginx-host-volume.yaml
    pod "nginx" created
    
    kubectl get pod nginx
    NAME      READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    nginx     1/1       Running   0          3m

Check for pod IP address and try to access the nginx application

    kubectl get po/nginx -o yaml | grep podIP
    podIP: 172.30.41.7
    
    curl 172.30.41.7:80
    403 Forbidden

we get *forbidden* since the html content dir (mounted as volume on the host node) is initially empty.

Login to the host node pod populate the volume dir

    [root@kubew05 ~]# echo "Hello from $(hostname)"  > /data/nginx/html/index.html

Back to the master node and access the service

    curl 172.30.41.7:80
    Hello from kubew05

Data in host dir volume will survive to any crash and restart of both container and pod. To test this, delete the pod and create it again

    kubectl delete pod nginx
    pod "nginx" deleted

    kubectl create -f nginx-host-volume.yaml
    pod "nginx" created

    kubectl get po/nginx -o yaml | grep podIP
      podIP: 172.30.41.7

    curl 172.30.41.7:80
    Hello from kubew05

This works because we forced kubernetes to schedule the nginx pod always on the same host node.

## Daemons
A Daemon Set is a controller type ensuring each node in the cluster runs a pod. As new node is added to the cluster, a new pod is added to the node. As the node is removed from the cluster, the pod running on it is removed and not scheduled on another node. Deleting a Daemon Set will clean up all the pods it created.

The configuration file ``nginx-daemon-set.yaml`` defines a daemon set for the nginx application
```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  labels:
    run: nginx
  name: nginx-ds
  namespace:
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      run: nginx-ds
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        run: nginx-ds
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: nginx:latest
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        name: nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
          protocol: TCP
      dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
      restartPolicy: Always
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 30
```

Create the daemon set and get information about id 

    kubectl create -f nginx-daemon-set.yaml
    
    kubectl get ds nginx-ds -o wide
    NAME     DESIRED CURRENT READY UP-TO-DATE AVAILABLE NODE-SELECTOR  AGE CONTAINER(S) IMAGE(S)     SELECTOR
    nginx-ds 3       3       3     3          3         <none>         4m  nginx        nginx:latest run=nginx-ds

There are exactly three pods since we have three nodes

    kubectl get pods -o wide
    NAME                     READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE       IP           NODE
    nginx-ds-b9rnc           1/1       Running   0          7m        10.38.0.20   kubew05
    nginx-ds-k5898           1/1       Running   0          7m        10.38.1.25   kubew04
    nginx-ds-nfr32           1/1       Running   0          7m        10.38.2.17   kubew03

and each pod is running on a different node.

Trying to delete a node from the cluster, the running pod on it is removed and not scheduled on other nodes as happens with other types of controllers

    kubectl delete node kubew03

    kubectl get pods -o wide
    NAME                     READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE       IP           NODE
    nginx-ds-b9rnc           1/1       Running   0          7m        10.38.0.20   kubew05
    nginx-ds-k5898           1/1       Running   0          7m        10.38.1.25   kubew04

Adding back the node to the cluster, we can see a new pod scheduled on that node.

    kubectl get pods -o wide
    NAME                     READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE       IP           NODE
    nginx-ds-b9rnc           1/1       Running   0          7m        10.38.0.20   kubew05
    nginx-ds-k5898           1/1       Running   0          7m        10.38.1.25   kubew04
    nginx-ds-61swl           1/1       Running   0          3s        10.38.2.18   kubew03

To delete a daemon set

    kubectl delete ds nginx-ds

A daemon set object is not controlled by the kubernetes scheduler since there is only a pod for each node. As a test, login to the master node and stop the scheduler

    systemctl stop kube-scheduler

Now create the daemon set

    kubectl create -f nginx-daemon-set.yaml

We can see pods scheduled on each node

    kubectl get pods -o wide
    NAME                     READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE       IP           NODE
    nginx-ds-b9rnc           1/1       Running   0          7m        10.38.0.20   kubew05
    nginx-ds-k5898           1/1       Running   0          7m        10.38.1.25   kubew04
    nginx-ds-nfr32           1/1       Running   0          7m        10.38.2.17   kubew03
    
It is possible to esclude some nodes from the daemon set by forcing the node selector. For example to run a nginx pod only on the ``worker03`` node, set the node selecto in the ``nginx-daemon-set.yaml`` configuration file above

```yaml
...
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: nginx:latest
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        name: nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
          protocol: TCP
...
      nodeSelector:
        kubernetes.io/hostname: kubew03

```

Create the new daemon set and cjeck the pods running on the nodes

    kubectl create -f nginx-daemon-set.yaml
    
    kubectl get pods -o wide
    NAME                     READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE       IP           NODE
    nginx-ds-vwm8w           1/1       Running   0          2m        10.38.2.20   kubew03

## Namespaces
Kubernetes supports multiple virtual clusters backed by the same physical cluster. These virtual clusters are called namespaces. Within the same namespace, kubernetes objects name should be unique. Different objects in different namespaces may have the same name.

Kubernetes comes with two initial namespaces

  * **default**: the default namespace for objects with no other namespace
  * **kube-system** the namespace for objects created by the kubernetes system

To get namespaces

    kubectl get namespaces
    NAME          STATUS    AGE
    default       Active    7d
    kube-system   Active    7d


To see objects belonging to a specific namespace

    kubectl get all --namespace default

    NAME           DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
    deploy/nginx   2         2         2            2           52s
    NAME             CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
    svc/kubernetes   10.254.0.1     <none>        443/TCP          7d
    svc/nginx        10.254.33.40   <nodes>       8081:31000/TCP   51s
    NAME                  DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
    rs/nginx-2480045907   2         2         2         52s
    NAME                        READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    po/nginx-2480045907-56t21   1/1       Running   0          52s
    po/nginx-2480045907-8n2t5   1/1       Running   0          52s

or objects belonging to all namespaces

    kubectl get service --all-namespaces
    NAMESPACE     NAME                   CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
    default       kubernetes             10.254.0.1       <none>        443/TCP          7d
    default       nginx                  10.254.33.40     <nodes>       8081:31000/TCP   2m
    kube-system   kube-dns               10.254.3.100     <none>        53/UDP,53/TCP    3d
    kube-system   kubernetes-dashboard   10.254.180.188   <none>        80/TCP           1d

Please, note that not all kubernetes objects are in namespaces, i.e. nodes, are cluster resources not included in any namespaces.

Define a new project namespace from the ``projectone-ns.yaml`` configuration file
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: projectone
```

Create the new namespace

    kubectl create -f projectone-ns.yaml
    namespace "projectone" created

    kubectl get ns project-one
    NAME          STATUS    AGE
    projectone   Active    6s

Objects can be assigned to a specific namespace in an explicit way, by setting the namespace in the metadata. For example, to create a nginx pod inside the project-one namespace, force the namespace in the pod definition file
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
  namespace: projectone
  labels:
    run: nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name: mynginx
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
```

Create the nginx pod and check it lives only in the project-one namespace

    kubectl create -f nginx-pod.yaml
    pod "nginx" created

    kubectl get pod nginx -n projectone
    NAME      READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    nginx     1/1       Running   0          51s

    kubectl get pod nginx
    Error from server (NotFound): pods "nginx" not found

Deleteing a namespace, will delete all the objects living in that namespaces. For example

    kubectl delete ns projectone
    namespace "projectone" deleted

    kubectl get pod  --all-namespaces

Another way to create object in namespaces is to force the desired namespace into the contest of *kubectl* command line. The kubectl is the client interface to interact with a kubernetes cluster. The contest of kubectl is specified into the ``~.kube/conf`` kubeconfig file. The contest defines the namespace as well as the cluster and the user accessing the resources.

See the kubeconfig file use the ``kubectl config view`` command

```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
    clusters:
    - cluster:
        server: http://kube00:8080
      name: musa-cluster
    contexts:
    - context:
        cluster: musa-cluster
        namespace: default
        user: admin
      name: default-context
    current-context: default-context
    kind: Config
    preferences: {}
    users:
    - name: admin
      user: {}    
```   
    
The file above defines a default-context operating on the musa-cluster as admin user. All objects created in this contest will be in the default namespace unless specified. We can add more contexts to use different namespaces and switch between contexts.

Create a new contest using the projectone namespace we defined above

    kubectl config set-credentials admin
    kubectl config set-cluster musa-cluster --server=http://kube00:8080
    kubectl config set-context projectone/musa-cluster/admin --cluster=musa-cluster --user=admin
    kubectl config set contexts.projectone/musa-cluster/admin.namespace projectone

The kubeconfig file now looks like
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
    server: http://kube00:8080
  name: musa-cluster
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: musa-cluster
    namespace: default
    user: admin
  name: default-context
- context:
    cluster: musa-cluster
    namespace: projectone
    user: admin
  name: projectone/musa-cluster/admin
current-context: default-context
kind: Config
preferences: {}
users:
- name: admin
  user: {}
```

It is not strictly required but it is a convention to use the name of contests as ``<namespace>/<cluster>/<user>`` combination. To switch contest use

    kubectl config use-context projectone/musa-cluster/admin
    Switched to context "projectone/musa-cluster/admin".

    kubectl config current-context
    projectone/musa-cluster/admin

Starting from this point, all objects will be created in the projectone namespace.

Switch back to default context

    kubectl config use-context default-context
    Switched to context "default-context".

## Quotas and Limits
Namespaces let different users or teams to share a cluster with a fixed number of nodes. It can be a concern that one team could use more than its fair share of resources. Resource quotas are the tool to address this concern. 

A resource quota provides constraints that limit aggregate resource consumption per namespace. It can limit the quantity of objects that can be created in a namespace by type, as well as the total amount of compute resources that may be consumed in that project.

Users create resources in the namespace, and the quota system tracks usage to ensure it does not exceed hard resource limits defined in the resource quota. If creating or updating a resource violates a quota constraint, the request will fail. When quota is enabled in a namespace for compute resources like cpu and memory, users must specify resources consumption, otherwise the quota system rejects pod creation.

Define a resource quota ``quota.yaml`` configuration file to assign constraints to current namespace
```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: project-quota
spec:
  hard:
    limits.memory: 1Gi
    limits.cpu: 1
    pods: 10
```

Create quota and check the current namespace

    kubectl config current-context
    projectone/musa-cluster/admin

    kubectl create -f quota.yaml
    resourcequota "project-quota" created

    kubectl describe ns projectone
    Name:   projectone
    Labels: type=project
    Status: Active

    Resource Quotas
     Name:          project-quota
     Resource       Used    Hard
     --------       ---     ---
     limits.cpu     0       1
     limits.memory  0       1Gi
     pods           0       10

    No resource limits.

Current namespace has now hard constraints set to 1 core CPU, 1 GB of RAM and max 10 running pods. Having set constraints for the namespace, all further requests for pod creation inside that namespace, must specify resources consumption, otherwise the quota system will reject the pod creation. 

Trying to create a nginx pod

    kubectl create -f nginx-pod.yaml
    Error from server (Forbidden) ..

The reason is that, by default, a pod try to allocate all the CPU and memory available in the system. Since we have limited cpu and memory consumption for the namespaces, the quota system cannot honorate a request for pod creation crossing these limits.

We can specify the resource contraint for a pod in its configuration file or in the ``nginx-deploy-limited.yaml`` configuration file
```yaml
...
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: nginx:latest
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: 200m
            memory: 512Mi
        name: nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
          protocol: TCP
...
```

and deploy the pod

    kubectl create -f nginx-deploy-limited.yaml
    deployment "nginx" created

    kubectl get pods
    NAME                     READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    nginx-3094295584-rsxns   1/1       Running   0          1m

The above pod can take up to 200 millicore of CPU, i.e. the 20% of total CPU resource quota of the namespace; it also can take up to 512 MB of memory, i.e. 50% of total memory resource quota.

So we can scale to 2 pod replicas

    kubectl scale deploy/nginx --replicas=2
    deployment "nginx" scaled

    kubectl get pods
    NAME                     READY     STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
    nginx-3094295584-bxkln   0/1       ContainerCreating   0          3s
    nginx-3094295584-rsxns   1/1       Running             0          3m

At this point, we consumed all memory quotas we reserved for the namespace. Trying to scale further

    kubectl scale deploy/nginx --replicas=3
    deployment "nginx" scaled

    kubectl get pods
    NAME                     READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    nginx-3094295584-bxkln   1/1       Running   0          2m
    nginx-3094295584-rsxns   1/1       Running   0          6m

    kubectl get all
    NAME           DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
    deploy/nginx   3         2         2            2           6m
    NAME                  DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
    rs/nginx-3094295584   3         2         2         6m
    NAME                        READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    po/nginx-3094295584-bxkln   1/1       Running   0          3m
    po/nginx-3094295584-rsxns   1/1       Running   0          6m

we cannot get more than 2 containers running.

Quotas lets the cluster administrators to control the resource consumption within a shared cluster. However, a single namespace may be used by more than a single user and it may deploy more than an application. To avoid a single pod consumes all resource of a given namespace, kubernetes introduces the limit range object. The limit range object limits the resources that a pod can consume by specifying the minimum, maximum and default resource consumption.

The configuration file ``limitranges.yaml`` defines limits for all containers running in the current namespace
```yaml
---
kind: LimitRange
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: container-limit-ranges
spec:
  limits:
  - type: Container
    max:
      cpu: 200m
      memory: 512Mi
    min:
      cpu:
      memory:
    default:
      cpu: 100m
      memory: 256Mi
```

Create the limit ranges object and inspect the namespace

    kubectl create -f limitranges.yaml
    limitrange "container-limit-ranges" created

    kubectl describe namespace projectone
    Name:   projectone
    Labels: type=project
    Status: Active

The current namespace defines limits for each container running in the namespace. If an user tryes to create a pod with a resource consumption more than limits range, the kubernetes scheduler will deny the request even if within the quota set.

Try to create a nginx pod as
```yaml
...
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:latest
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: 250m
        memory: 512Mi
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
...
```

our request will be denied

    kubectl create -f nginx-limited-pod.yaml
    Error from server (Forbidden): error when creating "nginx-limited-pod.yaml":
    pods "nginx" is forbidden: maximum cpu usage per Container is 200m, but limit is 250m.

The default value we set into limit range definition above is used as default for all pods that do not specify resource consumption. So, if we create a nginx pod as follow
```yaml
...
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:latest
    resources:
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
...
```

the pod will be created with the default resource consumption limits

    kubectl create -f nginx-limited-pod.yaml
    pod "nginx" created

    kubectl describe namespace projectone
    Name:   projectone
    Labels: type=project

Just to recap, quota defines the total amount of resources within a namespace, while limit ranges define the resource usage for a single pod within the same namespace.

Overcommitting of resource is possible, i.e. it is possible to specify limits exceding the real resources on the cluster nodes. To check real resources and their allocation, describe the worker nodes

    kubectl get nodes

    NAME      STATUS    AGE
    kuben05   Ready     6d
    kuben06   Ready     6d

    kubectl describe node kuben06
    ...
